# Counter Application

## Overview
The Counter application is a simple yet powerful tool designed using UIKit. It offers a clean and intuitive interface for incrementing or decrementing a numeric value. This app is perfect for tallying or tracking various counts in everyday tasks.

## Features
- **Increment Button**: A red circular button with a '+' symbol allows users to increase the count by one with each tap.
- **Decrement Button**: A blue circular button with a '-' symbol provides the functionality to decrease the count by one upon each press.
- **Count Display**: The current count is prominently displayed in a large font at the center of the screen, making it easy to read at a glance.
- **History Log**: Below the count display, the app maintains a detailed history of changes with timestamps, so users can keep track of how the count has been modified over time.
